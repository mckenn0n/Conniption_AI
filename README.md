Classes:
  ## main.py ##
  
  This is the UI class that is used for playing against the AI. It uses a REPL like input to control
  the execution. Before play can begin, three settings must be entered. The first requires that you
  input whether the AI plays first or second. This is set by entering the number 1 (for first) or 2
  (for second) after the prompt. Second, you will be asked whether you wish to play against the AI
  manually or have a random agent play against the AI. After the prompt, input "Yes" if the computer
  should play randomly or "No" if you wish to play manually. Finally, you will be prompted for the
  number of times you wish to play against the AI. This can be any integer, but moderate to large
  values can cause excessive memory usage due to the search keeping track of a visited list combined
  with python's unreliable garbage collection. Once these options are set, a list of commands will
  be displayed and the game will be started. On its turn, the AI will automatically be made to
  search for its next move. The available commands are described below. Parenthesis indicate
  optional character sequences and square brackets indicate that any character in the specified
  range may be used.

  a. q(uit)      - Closes the program early

  b. h(elp)      - Displays a list of commands

  c. d(isplay)   - Displays information about the current game state (this same state information
                   will be displayed at the beginning of every turn automatically)

  d. u(ndo)      - Returns the state to the user's most recent previous turn. This can only be used
                   to revert one turn at a given time because nodes further up the tree are deleted
                   periodically to reduce memory usage.

  e. (f)[1-7](f) - plays the move described by this string. This command can only be used when it is
                   the user's turn. The number is the only required character and indicates which
                   column a piece is to be placed in. The "f" characters, if included, indicate that
                   the board is to be flipped before/after the piece is placed.

  ## Conniption.py ##
  
  This class is used for defining, creating, and evaluating game states. The class is primarily composed of a Conniption object alongside its object methods, as well as a single static method.

  1.  Conniption Object:

      Conniption(board, player1Turn=True, flipsRem=(4,4), flippable=True, parent=None, resMove=None)
        
        This object encapsulates all relevent information about a given state of the game. The fields are as follows

        a. board - a tuple of length 7 that represents the layout of the game board. Each item in
           the tuple is a boolean tuple whose length can be in the range [0,6]. Each element in
           these sub-tuples is a boolean that indicate whose piece is in that position (True if
           that piece belongs to the AI, False otherwise).

        b. player1Turn - a boolean that is True if the AI is the next player to place a piece,
           False otherwise.

        c. flipsRem - an integer tuple of length 2. Each element is the number of flips that the
           corresponding player is still allowed to make, with the first element representing the
           AI and the second element representing the AI's opponent.

        d. flippable - a boolean that is True if the board is allowed to flip. This will only ever
           be False if the turn that led to this state included a flip after placing a piece.

        e. parent - the Conniption object that the current object was generated from. This should
           only be None for the root of the current search tree.

        f. resMove - A string of length 1, 2, or 3 that describes the move that must be used in
           order to transition from the parent state to this board state. The string will always
           include a number in the range [1,7] and may optionally include a lowercase 'f' before
           and/or after the number. These indicate that there is a flip before/after the piece is
           placed.

        g. children - A set of Conniption objects. This is the only field that cannot be set
           during initiation of the object and it can only be set by the genChildStates method.
           This set contains all Conniption objects that can be legally reached at the end of the
           current turn.

  2.  genChildStates()

        This method generates all game states that can be reached from the state described by the
        current object after a single move. In effect, this method is the expansion function for the
        game search. Importantly, this method will only execute if the children of the current state
        have not previously been computed to prevent unnecessary re-computation. Children are
        generated in 1-4 stages. Each stage cannot be executed unless the previous stage was also
        executed. They are listed below.

        a. noFlip - executed for all boards. Generates children that require no flips to reach.

        b. postFlip - only executed if the current player has flips remaining. Generates children
           that require a flip after placing a piece to reach. This stage utilizes the equivalence
           between a postFlip and placing a piece at the bottom of a column in an already-flipped board.

        c. preFlip - only executed if flippable is True. Generate children that require a flip
           before placing a piece to reach.
             
        d. dualFlip - only executed if the current player has at least two flips remaining.
           Generates children that require a flip both before and after placing a piece. This
           stage utilizes the equivalence between a dualFlip and placing a piece at the bottom of a
           column in a non-flipped board.

  3. betterEval()

  4. isWin()

        This function is the only static function in this class. It determines whether the current
        game state is a winning position for either player. It does this by iterating through each
        of the 69 possible lines of four cells and determining if the value of all four cells in a
        given line are the same (either all True or all False). If they are, then the appropriate
        player (AI if the cells are True, Opponent if they are False) is flagged as being in a win
        state. In order for the main function to be able to determine who won in the case of a flip
        causing both players to have a line of four, this function returns a tuple of two booleans
        where the first element is True only if the AI has a line of 4 and the second is True only
        if the opponent has a line of four.

  ## Alpha_Beta_Search.py ##

  This class is resposible for the game search.  The search used is iterative deepening with Alpha
  Beta Pruning.  The class has three methods:

  1.  alpha_beta_search()

        To start a search use the method alpha_beta_search() with the parameters for the current
        object of the board, the integer of max depth to search, and if the search should save the
        visited board states and their evaluation.  **Warning**: saving visited board for a large
        number of run against random will consume a large amount of ram.  
        This method sets the alpha to -infinity and beta to infinity at the root of the tree. For
        all children states in the current board, finds the max of the value or the min_value of
        the children. If the value is greater than alpha, alpha is set to the value and best_state
        is added to a list. The class will return the best state based on the best evaluation
        returned. 

  2.  min_value()

        Recursion helper method of finding the max value for a given depth. The base case of the
        search is when it has reached the max depth. If it is at the max depth, first check if the
        board is in a dictionary of board and their evaluation. If so returns the eval score, else
        calculate the board state and save it in the dictionary. Set value to infinity and for all
        children states in the board passed finds the min of the value or the max_value of the
        children.  If the value is less than or equal to alpha, then return the value because the
        branch can be pruned.  If not, the method should set the beta to the min value of beta or
        the value.

  3.  max_value()

        Recursion helper method of finding the max value for a given depth.  Base case is the same
        as min_value(). Next, the children states are generated of the board. Set value to -infinity
        and for all children states in the board passed find the max of value or min_value of the
        children.  If value is greater than or equal to beta, then return the value because the
        branch can be pruned. If not, the method should set the alpha to the max of alpha or value.
